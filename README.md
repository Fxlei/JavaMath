# JavaMath

Hi anyone who randomly finds my repository!

This is just a zone for testing for me.
While I follow some of the Github-guides here, I will try some other things too.
Thats why you could find some Java-code here, since I'm also trying Egit with it.
See http://eclipse.github.io/

The Java-snippets should be some Math-classes I recently wrote.
