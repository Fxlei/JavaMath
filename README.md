# JavaMath

Hi anyone who __randomly__ finds my repository!

This is just a testing-zone for me.
While I follow some of the [Github-*guides*](https://guides.github.com/) here, I will try some other things too.
Thats why you could find some **Java**-code here, since I'm also trying [Egit](http://eclipse.github.io/) and [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) in combination with this repository.

The Java-snippets should be some Math-classes I recently wrote.
